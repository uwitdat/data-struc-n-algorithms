/*  
    a graph is a data structure which links nodes 
    in a cyclic (all verticies are connected) 
    or acyclic (not all verticies are connected)

    - graphs store information in the nodes, but also
    in the edges (pointers) of the graph

    - a graph which stores information in the edges will
    be a weighted graph, where as a graph that does not 
    will be unweighted.
